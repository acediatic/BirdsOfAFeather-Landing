            Coding tuition is completed using CodeHS. It can be done remotely,
            and is very straightforward if you understand the fundamentals in
            the programming language you‚Äôre teaching. In essence, all lesson
            content is pre-prepared, which means all you need to do is show up,
            sign in with your student and pick up where you left off.
